## File structure is something to think about but following is how the

## file should be group and take together.

## Absences of index file makes App file the main root in theory should not be touched.

## I dont like index style of import from folder which makes folder name of the file index and all its stuff will not be used from now.

### Following how is files will be stuctured

- one main folder src will contain the four folder mentioned below and also a assets folder.

- Four folders will be thier components, screens, navigation ,styles and api that are constant and to be used every where.

## Each folder are structured to serve its purpose

- components folders will always have reusable components to be called a lot of time

- screens as the name sugest will always have the main screens that will be preivewed on screen

- nagivation file will always contain main navigation and its nested navigation. app will just take this navigation and render it.

- styles will always contain file that will be constant color like stuff.

- api will always contain fetch api files.

## the sturture will change further if their is more stuff like Context api.
